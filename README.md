# FrontEnd Challenge

Our FrontEnd challenge consists in trying to build a new marketplace of vehicles. This marketplace must has an admin area to manage vehicles such as `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `List All` and a `Details page`. On the `Details Page` our employers must be able to allow or not a car to be displayed on the marketplace area. 

Also it must has an public area a.k.a `Marketplace Area` to display all of these vehicles, such as an e-commerce page, containing the vehicle details such as mark, model, year, price, category, gas type, used KM and their photos.

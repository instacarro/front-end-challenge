# FrontEnd Challenge

Our FrontEnd challenge consists in trying to build a new marketplace of vehicles. This marketplace must has an admin area to manage vehicles such as `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `List All` and a `Details page`. On the `Details Page` our employers must be able to allow or not a car to be displayed on the marketplace area. 

Also it must has an public area a.k.a `Marketplace Area` to display all of these vehicles, such as an e-commerce page, containing the vehicle details such as mark, model, year, price, category, gas type, used KM and their photos. 

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Use TypeScript 
- React 
- NextJS
- Use `GitHub` to clone this repository and open a pull request following this pattern: `feature/your-full-goes-here`
- A `README.md` documenting how to run the project

### Optional and Plus
- Unit Tests
- Component Tests
- On the `Marketplace Area` a filter of cars by `Make`, `Model`, `Year` and `Used KM`.
- Try to make a container using `Docker` which builds a fresh and an usable image to deploy your project.
